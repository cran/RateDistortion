Description: An implementation of routines for solving rate-distortion problems.
  Rate-distortion theory is a field within information theory that
  examines optimal lossy compression. That is, given that some
  information must be lost, how can a communication channel be designed
  that minimizes the cost of communication error? Rate-distortion
  theory is concerned with the optimal  (minimal cost) solution to such
  tradeoffs. An important tool for solving rate-distortion problems is
  the Blahut algorithm, developed by Richard Blahut and described in:
 .
    Blahut, R. E. (1972). Computation of channel capacity and
  rate-distortion functions. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,
  IT-18(4), 460-473.
 .
    This package implements the basic Blahut algorithm, and additionally contains a number of `helper' functions, including a routine for searching for an information channel that minimizes cost subject to a constraint on information rate.
